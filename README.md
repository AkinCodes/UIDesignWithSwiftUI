# UIDesignWithSwiftUI
Creating an awesome UI with SwiftUI code.

Here I implemented a few stacks such as VStack, HStack, ZStack etc. I emplyed the use of images for icons as well as the background images. 
I wrote a placeholder display text for date, year and temperature.
A simple UI that I'm sure you will enjoy.

Get in touch today as I seek to work and collaborate and hopefully get my first entry iOS Developer job and opportunity.
